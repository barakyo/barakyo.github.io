<p>First of all, I know I&rsquo;m a little late to this, but I&rsquo;ve had these resolutions
for a while. I just feel like documenting them and putting them somewhere will
hopefully make me more accountable. In addition to posting them somewhere to
increase accountability, I need to revise some of these goals so that they&rsquo;re more
specific and measurable. I&rsquo;d like to review myself each month to keep track
of my progress.</p>

<p>Well, here it goes, 2019 Resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run a mile each day for a month</li>
<li>Complete Advent of Code 2018 in Haskell</li>
<li>Blog at least 3x a month</li>
<li>Improve my Hebrew literacy</li>
<li>Sign up for and run a 10K</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="run-a-mile-each-day-for-a-month">Run a Mile Each Day for a Month</h2>

<p>I use to love swimming but after I kept injuring myself, I realized it may not
be the sport for me. While I still swim from time to time, I don&rsquo;t do it
everyday like I use to. I started introducing different workouts into my
weekly exercises and running became one of them. While I enjoy running, I&rsquo;m also
doing a Bootcamp class on Monday, Wednesday, and sometimes Saturday of each week.
This leaves less days per week to run in addition to fatigue. As of this post
(January 12th 2019), I&rsquo;ve ran 11 miles this month so far. I&rsquo;m going to try
my best to keep it up!</p>

<h2 id="complete-advent-of-code-2018-in-haskell">Complete Advent of Code 2018 in Haskell</h2>

<p>I started this just before the New Year and I&rsquo;m really enjoying the challenge.
I think the hardest part of this is completing something that you&rsquo;re starting.
Well that and doing it in Haskell :P</p>

<h2 id="blog-at-least-3x-month">Blog at least 3x/Month</h2>

<p>I want to blog more consistently and I think this is a good goal to reach for.</p>

<h2 id="improve-my-hebrew-literacy">Improve my Hebrew Literacy</h2>

<p>I started learning to read Hebrew late last year on my own. While I know the
alphabet, reading is very tricky. I don&rsquo;t have a good plan for this, so I think
coming up with a plan first and making this a more measurable goal would really
help me achieving this goal.</p>

<h2 id="sign-up-and-run-a-10k">Sign up and run a 10K</h2>

<p>When I was swimming, I was always worried to sign up for a competition because
I didn&rsquo;t believe I was in my best form yet to compete. I didn&rsquo;t ever end up
competing because of that worry. My coworker, whom I run with, encouraged me
to sign up for a 10K. I think to get over my fear of being things needing to
be &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;&ldquo;, I should definitely do this. It kind of reminds me of the quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect is the enemy of done.</p>
</blockquote>
