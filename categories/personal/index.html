    Wow! I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s February already! As I stated in my New Year Resolutions post, I wrote down my resolutions so that I could be held accountable for them. Reviewing my resolutions after a year seemed like I would easily lose touch/sight of them. I decided a good idea would be to review my progress month-by-month, so here it goes:
Read more (and not programming/technical books) I believe I&rsquo;ve been doing a good job of this!  <a href="/post/2015-02-01-resolutions-one-month-review/">Read More...</a>

    With keeping up on my new year resolutions, the first book of 2015 that I decided to read was Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. I found the book browsing through Barnes and Nobles and realized it was surprisingly cheap on the Google Play Bookstore (sorry local Barnes and Nobles, have to justify my Nexus 7 purchase somehow).
I have to say that I hope the rest of the books I read this year are this good.  <a href="/post/2015-01-28-review-ready-player-one/">Read More...</a>

    Well I hope I&rsquo;m not too late to get my new year resolutions in. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this post for a while, but was only finally inspired after my last cup of coffee of 2014. In fact, this day included a lot of lasts. The last swim of the year, the last time I&rsquo;d visit my brother in 2014, the last time I&rsquo;d accidentally cut myself in 2014 (I hope), the last.  <a href="/post/2014-12-31-new-year-resolutions/">Read More...</a>

    Today I am 25 years, 5 months, and 14 days old, the exact same age my brother was when he passed away. This day has been on my mind everyday for the past year. I&rsquo;ve spent long car rides, sleepness nights, and countless laps swimming thinking about today, asking my self what should I do, what should I say. After wrestling with my thoughts, I thought it may be best to write out my thoughts and reflect.  <a href="/post/2014-10-02-25-years-5-months-14-days/">Read More...</a>

    Over this past weekend I was asked, twice, &ldquo;Why Barakyo?&rdquo; While the explanation is simple enough, I sometimes get the response that my Barakyo nickname isn&rsquo;t professional. I&rsquo;ve even been told I should consider choosing another domain name. While I understand that my nickname isn&rsquo;t professional and even though I share my blog with companies that I am interested in, I didn&rsquo;t want to strip my blog of me, hence the reason for the personal category.  <a href="/post/2013-11-12-why-barakyo/">Read More...</a>
