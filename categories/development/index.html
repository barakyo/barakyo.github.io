      Tutorial: Awesome Presentations with CodeHike

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>Background At work, we’ve been focusing on building components that are reusable and more flexible throughout our application. Because of this, we’ve been focusing on making components more composable. To really drive that point home, I gave a small presentation using an awesome library called Code Hike.
If you haven’t seen Code Hike before, you should definitely stop right here and at least give Rodrigo Pombo’s (the author of Code Hike) amazing article on Build Your Own React a quick look....</p>

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I recently read a really interesting and great blog post titled Lisp in your Language by Dan Prince. The article walked through an implementation of a subset of Lisp. After reading the post, I thought it was a great project to not only have a deeper understanding of Lisp but also of the language that the implementation is in. In fact, I was so inspired by the post, I decided that maybe I’d give it a shot to write it in Elixir....</p>

    <p>tl;dr I suggest using ObjectMapper found in the com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper

      Play! Framework -- Returning JSON Responses

  <section class="entry-content">
    <p>I’ve recently started a project at working using the Play Framework and while its a great framework, I was having a lot of trouble with some of the simplest tasks. I wouldn’t blame Play for my problems, returning to Java after a long hiatus, being spoiled by dynamicly typed languages, and lack of documentation really made such tasks like returning a JSON response difficult.
I figured that I may not be the only in this position, judging by the questions in the IRC channel and lack of responses, I figured it may be a good idea to jot down some of my notes, not only for myself, my coworkers, but for all my fellow Play framework noobs....</p>

    <p>Recently, the need for a standard numbering convention came up for one of our projects at work. The client requested to be able to access protocols by a unique ID. Originally I thought it’d be a no brainer, I’d explain to them that the each protocol is already uniquely identifiable within the database, and they can just refer to protocols by their unique ID in the database. Unfortunately, they didn’t seem too fond of the unique ID numbering scheme and proposed that the application follow a certain convention, which they created....</p>

    <p>It seems that Javascript challenges are more frequent at work.

    <p>Besides writing test cases just because “everyone else is”, we should be writing test cases since they’ll help create a stronger trust in our code that our functions are doing what they should be doing.

    <p>The other week we received a request for a small script from a department on campus. The department needed to evaluate data from a Microsoft Excel worksheet which they wrote a macro for. Their problem, though, was to aggregate all their data into one sheet. This aggregation process was not only the most tedious but was also their longest task taking nearly 2 weeks to complete. My coworkers and I were shocked that they’ve continued this process for so long without looking to automate it somehow, so we took on the challenge to ease the pain in their lives....</p>
