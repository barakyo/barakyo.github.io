      <description>I recently read a really interesting and great blog post titled Lisp in your Language by Dan Prince. The article walked through an implementation of a subset of Lisp. After reading the post, I thought it was a great project to not only have a deeper understanding of Lisp but also of the language that the implementation is in. In fact, I was so inspired by the post, I decided that maybe I&amp;rsquo;d give it a shot to write it in Elixir.</description>
