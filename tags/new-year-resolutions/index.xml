      <description>First of all, I know I&amp;rsquo;m a little late to this, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had these resolutions for a while. I just feel like documenting them and putting them somewhere will hopefully make me more accountable. In addition to posting them somewhere to increase accountability, I need to revise some of these goals so that they&amp;rsquo;re more specific and measurable. I&amp;rsquo;d like to review myself each month to keep track of my progress.</description>

      <description>Wow! I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s February already! As I stated in my New Year Resolutions post, I wrote down my resolutions so that I could be held accountable for them. Reviewing my resolutions after a year seemed like I would easily lose touch/sight of them. I decided a good idea would be to review my progress month-by-month, so here it goes:
Read more (and not programming/technical books) I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a good job of this!</description>

      <description>Well I hope I&amp;rsquo;m not too late to get my new year resolutions in. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this post for a while, but was only finally inspired after my last cup of coffee of 2014. In fact, this day included a lot of lasts. The last swim of the year, the last time I&amp;rsquo;d visit my brother in 2014, the last time I&amp;rsquo;d accidentally cut myself in 2014 (I hope), the last.</description>
