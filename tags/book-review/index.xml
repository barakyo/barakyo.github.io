      <description>With keeping up on my new year resolutions, the first book of 2015 that I decided to read was Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. I found the book browsing through Barnes and Nobles and realized it was surprisingly cheap on the Google Play Bookstore (sorry local Barnes and Nobles, have to justify my Nexus 7 purchase somehow).
I have to say that I hope the rest of the books I read this year are this good.</description>
