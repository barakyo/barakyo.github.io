      <description>Background At work, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on building components that are reusable and more flexible throughout our application. Because of this, we&amp;rsquo;ve been focusing on making components more composable. To really drive that point home, I gave a small presentation using an awesome library called Code Hike.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen Code Hike before, you should definitely stop right here and at least give Rodrigo Pombo&amp;rsquo;s (the author of Code Hike) amazing article on Build Your Own React a quick look.</description>
