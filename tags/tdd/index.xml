      <description>While browsing /r/javascript Thursday night, I came across a post regrading a mildly interesting interview question which had to do with flattening a Javascript object to a URI.
Two things immediately jumped into my mind:
I have to show one of my coworkers. This would make a &amp;ldquo;midly interesting&amp;rdquo; Python challenge! Friday morning, the first thing I did when I got into work was write the challenge on our white board and my solution in Python.</description>

      <description>It seems that Javascript challenges are more frequent at work. Thursday afternoon when we got back from lunch, my coworker was testing himself in the You Can&amp;rsquo;t Javascript Under Pressure challenges. As great coworkers, we (by that I mean, me) decided to help out and put more pressure on our fellow coworker, without even being asked to! One of the challenges that came up during the test was a function ArraySum() which accepts a list (array) of values and you must total all the integers within the array.</description>

      <description>Besides writing test cases just because &amp;ldquo;everyone else is&amp;rdquo;, we should be writing test cases since they&amp;rsquo;ll help create a stronger trust in our code that our functions are doing what they should be doing.
Requirements PHP PHPUnit (you will most likely need a global install) Test Cases (DUH) Helpers Helpers are a set of classes that we create to take care of common mundane tasks. For example, the User Helper for testing provides functions for returning a user with a specified role or easily create a new user with the specified role if one does not exist or the user requests one.</description>
