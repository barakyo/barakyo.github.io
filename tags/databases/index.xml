      <description>Recently, the need for a standard numbering convention came up for one of our projects at work. The client requested to be able to access protocols by a unique ID. Originally I thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a no brainer, I&amp;rsquo;d explain to them that the each protocol is already uniquely identifiable within the database, and they can just refer to protocols by their unique ID in the database. Unfortunately, they didn&amp;rsquo;t seem too fond of the unique ID numbering scheme and proposed that the application follow a certain convention, which they created.</description>
